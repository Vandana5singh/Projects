## INTRODUCTION
Lending money is essential in today's modern day. A large portion of a bank's revenue comes from this. The purchasing of houses and cars becomes possible, individual are able to better manage their living and educational expenses. This project is about solving binary classification problem that whether the loan should be sanctioned or not. 

## PROBLEM
Analyzing if an applicant's profile is loan-worthy is based on several factor. Understandig those factors and taking decision is a hectic task.  Machine Learning model can help housing companies saving time by predicting whether a candidate's profile is appropriate based on key characteristics such as applicant income, marital status, education level, credit history, etc.

## MOTIVATION
The issue of loan projection is a prevalent real-world challenge that every retail bank encounters at least once in its existence. When executed accurately, it has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time spent by employees at a retail bank.

## STEPS INVOLVED IN MODEL BUILDING
1.Understanding The Data
2.Data preprocessiong -Dealing with Missing Values
3.Exploratory Data Analysis-Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis,Multivariate Analysis(Correlation)
4.Model Building-XG Boost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
5.Compare performance metric based on Accuracy score

## Results
As the project required a classification model, four distinct classifiers—XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were strategically employed. Hypertuning was applied to fine-tune these models, enhancing their performance and generalization capabilities. Following a rigorous comparison based on Accuracy Score metrics, Random Forest emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 87%.
